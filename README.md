# Normal-Resistivity-Corrector
Script to determine formation resistivity given borehole fluid conductivity, borehole diameter, and apparent normal resistivity at a given separation. Assumes tool is centralized. Imports AEM sounding depths and exports corrected normal resistivity data averaged for those sounding depth intervals.
