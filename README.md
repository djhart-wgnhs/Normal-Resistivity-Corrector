# Normal-Resistivity-Corrector
Script to determine formation resistivity given borehole fluid conductivity, borehole diameter, and apparent normal resistivity at a given separation. Assumes tool is centralized. Imports AEM sounding depths and exports corrected normal resistivity data averaged for those sounding depth intervals. Uses polynomial formula from USGS pub, based on Schlumberger correction. https://www.usgs.gov/publications/a-fortran-algorithm-correcting-normal-resistivity-logs-borehole-diameter-and-mud Could use the las function but prefer to use pandas tables rather than arrays. https://pypi.org/project/las/
