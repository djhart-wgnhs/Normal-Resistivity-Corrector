# Normal-Resistivity-Corrector
Script to determine formation resistivity given borehole fluid conductivity, borehole diameter, and apparent normal resistivity at a given separation. Assumes tool is centralized. Uses polynomial formula from USGS pub, based on Schlumberger correction. https://www.usgs.gov/publications/a-fortran-algorithm-correcting-normal-resistivity-logs-borehole-diameter-and-mud.
